            <H2>Wat is Amazon Web Services?</H2>
            <p>
                Born out of a need to expand Amazon beyond books, AWS has created a multibillion-dollar industry, but
                now for the first time faces serious competition
            </p>
            <p>
                Amazon Web Services (AWS) is het cloudplatform van de Amerikaanse e-commercegigant Amazon. Door het
                brede scala aan software en services die het AWS-platform biedt, beheert Amazon een public cloud van
                ongekende omvang en zijn ze sinds 2010 jaarlijks wereldwijd verkozen tot absolute marktleider volgens
                Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for
                Cloud Infrastructure as a Service. AWS biedt iedere organisatie (van start-up tot multinational) toegang
                tot een zeer snelle, flexibele IT-omgeving, tegen zeer beperkte kosten. Maar wat is AWS eigenlijk? En
                welke mogelijkheden biedt AWS voor uw organisatie?

                The roots of AWS extend back as early as 2000, when Amazon was an e-commerce company coping with scale
                problems. As it attempted to add new applications to serve its retail customers, Amazon was hamstrung by
                “monolithic” software and sets of databases that, as Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels put it,
                required rewriting swaths of computer code.

                Amazon began to splinter its three largest data sets — customers, goods and orders — into separate items
                that, in turn, were broken down into smaller units, such as login information or security requirements.
                At the same time, Amazon began offering computer systems and tools, such as renting IT infrastructure
                and applications online to other tech ventures, so they could sell their own products via Amazon.com.

                Moving to that type of structure allowed Amazon customers to outsource their computing needs — be it
                storage, servers or networking — on a pay-as-you-go basis. “That was the driver for what later became
                AWS,” Vogels said.

            <p>
                The timing was precipitous — as more companies began to look to store vast troves of data and computing
                power, Amazon was pouring billions of dollars into research and development. What became AWS first
                surfaced in 2004 and officially launched in 2006, with its first cloud products Simple Storage Service
                (S3) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and by 2015 it was bringing in nearly $8 billion a year.

                Amazon wasn’t just the first to market with a modern cloud infrastructure service: It built on its
                product with applications for robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and a phalanx of
                databases.

                Consider: DeepLens gives developers a view of machine learning via a fully programmable video camera.
                The RoboMaker app helps companies develop and deploy robot control systems. (The code name for AWS’s
                robotics effort was B9, after the iconic robot in the 1960s TV series, “Lost In Space.”) The Database
                Freedom program helps customers shift from traditional database engines to cloud-native ones on AWS.
                Special-purpose hardware like AWS’s Snowmobile data-storage boxes can move petabytes of data.

                “Ten years ago, [Amazon CEO] Jeff [Bezos] and Andy [Jassy] understood [machine learning] would transform
                Amazon in a big way,” Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president responsible for artificial intelligence and
                machine learning at AWS, told MarketWatch.

                “Historically, [machine learning] has been hungry for compute infrastructure and data, but it was not
                accessible for most companies,” said Sivasubramanian, who as a research intern at Amazon in the early
                2000s saw the potential of the cloud-computing concept. “AWS is making it accessible.”

                For more: The engine for Amazon earnings growth has nothing to do with e-commerce

                Shawn Bice, vice president in charge of database business, added that AWS’s full embrace of specialized
                databases has eased the ability of customers to adapt quickly, and easily, to the cloud.

                To deliver customers the computer capacity necessary for AI, data analytics and other advanced
                technologies, Amazon has assembled a network of new data centers in more than 20 geographic regions.

                Forrester estimates AWS spends billions of dollars each quarter building new data centers or expanding
                existing ones. Few cloud vendors can match Amazon’s spending, according to Forrester.
